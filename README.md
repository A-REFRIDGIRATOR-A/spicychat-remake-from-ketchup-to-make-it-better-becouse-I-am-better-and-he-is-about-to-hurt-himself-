This is a **fanmade** remake of [Spicychat](https://spicychat.ai).

## Why does this exist?
The goal of this project is to not only show how Spicychat could look with an upgraded UI, but to provide the devs with useful components to (hopefully) get them to stop using NextUI.

## Can I help?
Well yes but actually no. As of right now this is purely a solo passion project. However, you are free to help fix any bugs and make suggestions but I will not be merging any PRs that add anything new.

## You could have done X thing better
If you've found something in my code that could have been made better then PLEASE open an issue and tell me about it. :)

Note that I will commit changes that are not fully implemented or are buggy and lack proper testing. So keep that in mind as well.
